public class NonRepeatingCharacter {

    /*
    * Our startup is building a new messaging feature in our app, and we need to find the first non-repeating
    * character in a string to ensure all the messages are valid. We need a function that takes a string
    * and returns the index of the first non-repeating character.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   String s = ""leetcode"";
    *   expectedOutput = 0;
    *   output should be 0 since 'l' is the first non-repeating character in the string
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   String s = ""startup"";
    *   expectedOutput = 2;
    *   output should be 2 since 'a' is the first non-repeating character in the string
    *
