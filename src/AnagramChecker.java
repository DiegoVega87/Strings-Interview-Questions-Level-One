public class AnagramChecker {

    /*
    * We want to implement a feature that checks if our users' passwords are anagrams to increase security.
    * Your task is to write a function that takes in two string inputs and returns true if they form an anagram,
    * and false if they do not. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word
    * or phrase. The resulting word or phrase contains all the original letters exactly once. For example,
    * the word ""listen"" can be rearranged to form the word ""silent,"" making ""silent"" an anagram of ""listen.""
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   String s1 = ""listen"";
    *   String s2 = ""silent"";
    *   output should be true
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   String s1 = ""hello"";
    *   String s2 = ""world"";
    *   output should be false
     * */
